        “Maths is for boys” and “Girl’s don’t do math” are common statements from children in America. <a href=" https://srcd.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1111/j.1467-8624.2010.01529.x"> (Cvencek, Meltzoff and Greenwald, 2011).</a> These stereotypes reflect the way in which girls view themselves compared to boys when it comes to their mathematical skills. In my article, I will explore the psychological reasons as to why young girls believe they are incapable of being at the same level as boys in math, and how this perception affects their lives in adulthood. Additionally, the racial stereotype affecting a child’s mathematical ability is also an interesting topic that I will explore as the significantly different cultural backgrounds play a huge factor in the way a child is raised and the impact it makes on their education.

        Self-esteem and confidence are one of the main reasons as to why girls believe to be less proficient at the subject compared to boys. It is crucial to build confidence in children from an early age, as various factors in their daily lives can influence this. For instance, an increased presence of female teachers will boost confidence in young girls and encourage them to do better in math. However, if a teacher is more biased towards the male students, the girls’ confidence in themselves is severely reduced leading to worser math scores. A lack of female role models contributes to lower confidence in girls. Not being able to envision themselves excelling in the subject can majorly affect their confidence as well. The lack of female role models, including famous mathematicians and teachers in everyday life, can be another reason to this lack of confidence. According to the empathising systemising theory, a theory that suggests that during prenatal development, the pre natal testosterone exposure is higher in male fetus’ compared to female, there is a suggestion that this difference in hormone exposure may contribute to variations in cognitive styles between boys and girls. It suggests that boys tend to develop a more systematic thinking approach, focusing on analysing and understanding systems, while girls may lean towards an empathetic thinking style, emphasising emotional understanding and social connections. The educational background of a child’s parent can indeed play a role into their mathematical abilities. If parents with lower levels of education invest less in a girls compared a boy’s education, it may suggest that cultural beliefs are affecting the math gender gap. However, having parents with higher levels of education can mean that they understand the importance of educating both genders equally and therefore provide the same resources for both. Additionally, it can also be dependent on the wealth and financial situation of a family. In some cases, if a family cannot afford to educate both genders, they may tend to only invest into the boys. This is because they think the boys will be able to secure a good job and provide for their families. However, in some countries where women perform better, they may have greater access to higher quality job opportunities compared to men. (Nollenberger, Rodríguez-Planas and Sevilla, 2016) These improved career prospects will result in them earning higher wages and being promoted which will contribute 
        There are many famous scientists and mathematicians for students to look up to. Some of the top names that are widely recognised by most people include Pythagoras, Albert Einstein and Isaac Newton. However, it's worth noting that most of these prominent figures are male. In the past, there were fewer female mathematicians who gained the same level of recognition. This lack of representation can significantly impact the rate at which young girls develop an interest in mathematics and go on to discover and contribute more to the world. Female mathematicians like Ada Lovelace, who made a ground breaking contribution by writing the world’s first computer program in 1836. Despite her significant achievements, her name remains less familiar compared to the male mathematicians. Historically, the representation of female mathematicians has been limited in comparison to their male counterparts in terms of fame and recognition. The limited number of female mathematicians in the limelight can discourage girls from pursuing mathematical studies and hinder their potential to make important discoveries and contributions. Therefore, it is importance to shed light on the accomplishments made by female mathematicians, such as Ada Lovelace, as this will inspire more young girls to embrace mathematics as a field of study.
        In many cultures, parents tend to focus on their sons and invest more time and resources into their education compared to girls where they would rather teach them other things. This is because they expect the sons to get a job and support the family. On the other hand, they may focus on teaching the girls skills which are seemed more appropriate for homemaking. This mindset and culture norm can be hard on girls who want to achieve more in life and challenge these gender roles. The racial background of a child also makes a noteworthy impact of their math scores in tests. In 2021, the percentage of pupils meeting the expected standard in maths was recorded based on their ethnicity. 70% of White children met the expected standard whereas 80% of Asian children including Indian, Pakistani, Bangladeshi and others met the standard. The highest percentage was observed among Chinese students, with 93% meeting the expected standard. (www.ethnicity-facts-figures.service.gov.uk, 2023) A full list including other ethnicities can be found in figure 1. One of the reasons of this is due to the fact that Asians and Chinese people have a different worth ethic and values instilled in their cultures, which parents try to implement into the children. In Japan, the education system is hierarchical and therefore the children there work harder to be the best in order to excel and achieve more success in life. In the past, students went to school in Japan for six days a week which added up to 240 days a year. In America, students went to school for 180 days a year. (www.otago.ac.nz, n.d.) This huge gap shows how the different countries have contrasting standards for their students.
